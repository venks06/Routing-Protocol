Routing Protocol - Bellman Ford Algorithm

Distance-vector routing protocols use the Bellman–Ford algorithm. A distance-vector routing protocol requires that 
a router inform its neighbors of topology changes periodically. Bellman–Ford is based on the principle of relaxation, 
in which an approximation to the correct distance is gradually replaced by more accurate values until eventually 
reaching the optimum solution. The approximate distance to each vertex is always an overestimate 
of the true distance, and is replaced by the minimum of its old value with the length of a newly found path.
